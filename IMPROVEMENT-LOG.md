## 2025-09-15 - Power BI Embedded Reporting Solution

### Timestamp
- Date: 2025-09-15
- Time: 15:40:00 PST

### Technical Explanation
Successfully implemented and fixed a complete Power BI embedded reporting solution with the following key improvements:

1. **Fixed Power BI SDK Loading Issue**
   - Problem: The Power BI SDK wasn't loading properly due to CSP (Content Security Policy) restrictions and incorrect object references
   - Solution:
     - Updated CSP headers to allow cdn.jsdelivr.net in the scriptSrc directive
     - Changed from static script tag to dynamic SDK loading
     - Fixed object references from `powerbi.models` to `window['powerbi-client'].models`
     - Updated service initialization to use proper factory methods

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Created Express backend with proper token generation and caching
   - Implemented Azure AD authentication using client credentials flow
   - Added proper error handling and retry logic (3 retries with exponential backoff)
   - Implemented token refresh 5 minutes before expiry
   - Added responsive design with loading states and connection indicators

### Failed Attempts
1. Initially tried to use `powerbi.models.TokenType` directly, but the SDK structure had changed
2. First CSP configuration blocked the CDN URL for the Power BI SDK
3. Static script loading wasn't working due to timing issues

### Impact on System
- Power BI reports now load successfully in the browser
- Token management ensures continuous access without manual intervention
- Error handling provides clear feedback to users
- System is production-ready for Azure deployment

### Files Modified
- `server.js` - Updated CSP headers to allow CDN access
- `public/index.html` - Changed to dynamic SDK loading
- `public/app.js` - Fixed SDK references and added dynamic loading function
- `.gitignore` - Already existed with proper configuration
- `IMPROVEMENT-LOG.md` - Created this log file

### Configuration Used
- Azure AD App Registration: Client ID: 5b0bd219-059d-4bdd-b3ca-4df448b28944
- Power BI Workspace ID: 62a9ad6b-0b51-4f51-90e1-2764815f0ec1
- Report ID: acb5b2a6-93fe-46a5-8c67-cdeb0dba4bc3
- Service Principal has Member access to workspace

### Test Results
- Server starts successfully on port 3000
- Azure AD token acquisition: ✓ Working
- Power BI embed token generation: ✓ Working
- Report display in browser: ✓ Working (shows Accounts Payable, Top Bills, Overdue Bills tabs)
- Token refresh: ✓ Scheduled for 57 minutes
- Connection status: ✓ Shows "Connected"
