- **Logs:** Clean after TENANT_ID fix
- **Live URL:** https://web-powerbi-embed-prod.azurewebsites.net

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
✅ **NONE REQUIRED** - Deployment is functional

### Future Improvements
1. **Fix Refresh Button Logic:**
   - Check for existing embed before re-embedding
   - Implement proper cleanup before refresh

2. **Add Favicon:**
   - Upload favicon.ico to public folder

3. **Update CSP Policy:**
   - Use specific Power BI domains instead of wildcards
